The custom ~resume.cls~ class wont be usable unless it's in ~org-latex-classes~. We
also need, in the same definition, to provide numbered and unnumbered mappings
for each level of header.

One of Malabarba's very good ideas is an alist, ~(exporter-backend (property
. fun-to-call-on-prop))~, defined with ~defcustom~. This is incredibly flexible --
but I don't actually need that much flexibility.
